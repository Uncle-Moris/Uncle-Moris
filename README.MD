Hi! 👋 I'm Maurycy, a DevOps engineer based in Warsaw with a strong background in automation and process optimization. My favorite technologies include Python 🐍, Linux 🐧, and AWS ☁️.

I love helping out with building CI/CD processes 🚀 and planning infrastructure, especially for smaller, hobby projects. It's really rewarding to design smooth workflows that make development and deployment easier.

Currently, I'm focusing on deepening my knowledge of AWS and working towards obtaining AWS certifications. I'm particularly interested in designing scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.

Here are some of the skills I bring to the table:

- 🔧 Automating infrastructure and configuration with Terraform and Python
- 🛠️ Building CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions
- 📊 Monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack
- ☁️ Managing AWS services such as EC2, RDS, S3, and Lambda
- 🔒 Implementing security best practices and infrastructure as code

I'm always happy to help with building CI/CD pipelines or designing a solution for your project in AWS! Let's connect and make something great together! 🌟
