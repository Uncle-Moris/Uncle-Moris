ðŸ‘‹ **DevOps Engineer**

Hi! I'm Maurycy, a DevOps engineer based in Warsaw with a strong background in automation and process optimization.
My favorite technologies include Python, Linux and AWS.


I love helping out with building CI/CD processes and planning infrastructure, especially for smaller, hobby projects.
It's really rewarding to design smooth workflows that make development and deployment easier. 

Currently, I'm focusing on deepening my knowledge of AWS and working towards obtaining AWS certifications. I'm particularly interested in learning more about designing scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.

I'm always happy to help with building CI/CD pipelines or designing a solution for your project in AWS.
